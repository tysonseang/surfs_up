Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.


## Overview

This project entails writing and executing Python code in Jupyter Notebook, using SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database, plotting data in the form of histograms and bar plots using Matplotlib plotting library, and analyzing descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of a dataset's distribution. SQLite is a widely used database engine, and SQLAlchemy is a tool designed to query SQLite databases. 

In this hypothetical scenario, I have pitched a new business idea for a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oâ€˜ahu. After presenting my business plan, a potential investor expressed concerns about the potential impact of local weather on customer foot traffic and sales. In order to secure investor backing, I first needed to run some analytics on a weather dataset to analyze temperature and precipitation from a variety of local weather stations. 




## Results
Temperature for at the proposed store location is close to perfect year-round. 
- For the month of June, the low (minimum) temperature is 64 degrees, the high (maximum) temperature is 85 degrees, and the average temperature is 75 degrees.
